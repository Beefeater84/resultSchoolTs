To keep myself up to date, I not only try new techniques, but also take courses from authors I respect.

Now I've decided to update my knowledge of typescript with https://result.school/ (especially since ts 5 was recently released)

That's the first task.

## to build: 

This does not run the test server, but only compiles files from src. To view the project you need to run ```dist/html``` on the built in IDE server

```
run "build-dev"
```
